What does "spike" mean?
==============================
I get asked "What does `spike` mean?" a lot.  Well, here's the answer (from
[The Agile Dictionary](http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/))

> A story or task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather
> than at producing shippable product. Sometimes a user story is generated that
> cannot be estimated until the development team does some actual work to resolve
> a technical question or a design problem. The solution is to create a “spike,”
> which is a story whose purpose is to provide the answer or solution. Like any
> other story or task, the spike is then given an estimate and included in the
> sprint backlog.
