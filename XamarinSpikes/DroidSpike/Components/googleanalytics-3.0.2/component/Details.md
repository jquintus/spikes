#Optimize Your Business Using the Google Analytics Platform

The Google Analytics Platform lets you measure user interactions with your business across various devices and environments, at Google speed and scale.
Gain new insights and optimize the performance of your business.

The platform provides all the computing resources to collect, store, process, and report on these user-interactions.

#Platform Components

Developers interact and influence processing through a rich user interface, client libraries, and APIs that are organized into 4 main components: collection configuration, processing, and reporting. The following diagram describes the relationships between the components and APIs:

* **Collection** – collects user-interaction data.
* **Configuration** – allows you to manage how the data is processed.
* **Processing** – processes the user-interaction data, with the configuration data.
* **Reporting** – provides access to all the processed data.

#Use it in your Xamarin Apps

This component will allow you to collect user-interaction data in your **Xamarin.iOS** and **Xamarin.Android** Applications so you can take advantage of the Google Analytics Platform.
